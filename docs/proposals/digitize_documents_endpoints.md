# Digitize Documents Service 
 
## Current Design: 

User can interact with document ingestion pipeline via cli commands and can run the below command to run the ingestion(convert/process/chunk/index) after placing the documents in the expected directory of the host i.e. /var/lib/ai-services/applications/<app-name>/docs. 
```
ai-services application start <app-name> --pod=<app-name>--ingest-docs 
```
In case if user wants to clean it up, can run below command which will clean up the vdb & local cache of processed files. 
```
ai-services application start <app-name> --pod=<app-name>--clean-docs 
```
There is no option to just convert and not ingest the converted content into the vdb. 
 
## Proposal: 
 
As per the requirement from PM, need to convert cli into microservice which expose REST endpoints to do the digitize document service’s tasks, which are to
- Convert the file from source format pdf to output format and return the result
- Ingest the document after the conversion by going through following tasks 
    - process text & table 
    - chunking 
    - create embeddings & index it to vdb. 
- Also need to expose the service to the outside world for the end user consumption. Port 4000 can be considered
 
## Endpoints: 

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Content-Type | Expected Success |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POST** | `/v1/digitizations` | Synchronous PDF conversion. | `multipart/form-data` | `200 OK` |
| **POST** | `/v1/ingestions` | Asynchronous document ingestion on a background process. | `multipart/form-data` | `202 Accepted` |
| **GET** | `/v1/ingestions` | Retrieve the status of currently ingested documents. | `application/json` | `200 OK` |
| **GET** | `/v1/documents` | Retrieve the list of currently ingested documents with its metadata. | `application/json` | `200 OK` |
| **GET** | `/v1/documents/{document_id}` | Retrieve metadata of a specific ingested document. | `application/json` | `200 OK` |
| **DELETE** | `/v1/documents/{document_id}` | Remove a specific document from vdb & clear its cache | N/A | `204 No Content` |
| **DELETE** | `/v1/documents` | Bulk delete all documents from vdb & cache. | N/A | `204 No Content` |

### POST /v1/digitizations - Synchronous conversion

**Content Type:** multipart/form-data 
 
**Query Params:**
- output_format - str  - Optional param to mention the required output format of the pdf, Options: 'md/text/json', Default: 'json'

**Description:**
- User can pass the pdf directly as a byte stream and API server should convert the file into output_format(default: json) and return the result. 
- User should pass only one file at a time for conversion and it should not exceed 100 pages, since it would take lot of time to convert and cannot be done on a sync network call. 
- Why 100 pages?
    - This is something we need to assess and get feedback from PM to decide the number of pages to be supported. To get started on a number I mentioned 100 since that is not too much and not too small as well. 
    - The docling serve API project https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve currently returns the result irrespective of the number of pages for the sync conversion requests. So we can also follow similar fashion to return the results.
    - Also from our experience 100 page pdf can be converted within couple of mins. Hence the size.
- Rate limiter would be added around conversion job to limit the number of conversion happen in parallel

**Sample curl:**
```
> curl -X 'POST' \ 
  'http://localhost:4000/v1/digitizations?output_format=md' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/file.pdf'
> 
``` 
**Response codes:** 

| Status Code | Description | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **200 OK** | Success | Request successful. Returns `{ "result": ... }`. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Missing File | No file was attached to the request. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Multiple Files | Only one file is permitted per request. |
| **415 Unsupported Media Type** | Invalid Format | File must be a valid, non-corrupt PDF. |
| **413 Payload Too Large** | Page Limit Exceeded | The number of pages exceeds the maximum allowed limit. |
| **429 Too Many Requests** | Rate Limit | Request denied due to high volume (throttling). |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on the server side. | 

**Sample response:**

```
{
    "result": ... // str/dict - str in case of md/text output_format & dict in case of json output format.
}
```

### POST /v1/ingestions - Asynchronous ingestion

**Content Type:** multipart/form-data 

**Description:**
- User can send single or multiple files on the request and the ingestion will happen in a background process
- Only one ingestion will be allowed at a time
- App server should do following things on receiving the request: 
    - Validate no lock file exist already to ensure there is no ingestion in progress. 
    - Start the ingestion process in a background process  
    - Create a LOCK file in /var/lib/ai-services/applications/<app-name>/cache/
    - Create /var/lib/ai-services/applications/<app-name>/cache/status.json to manage/view the status of ingestion 
    - End the request 202 Accepted response
- Background ingestion process should write the status into status.json like following information 
    - Current stage(conversion/processing/chunking/indexing) 
    - Stats of current stage (timings, number of pages, tables …) 
    - Once done with all the stages, it should remove the LOCK file and conclude the job. 

**Sample curl:**
```
> # Ingest the attached files 
> curl -X 'POST' \ 
  'http://localhost:4000/v1/ingestions' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/file1.pdf' \ 
  -F 'file=@/path/to/file2.pdf' \ 
> 
```
**Response codes:** 

| Status Code | Description | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **202 Accepted** | Success | Request accepted. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Missing File | No files were attached to the request. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Duplicate Files | Request contains files with duplicate names. |
| **415 Unsupported Media Type** | Invalid Format | File must be a valid, non-corrupt PDF. |
| **409 Conflict** | Ingestion Busy | Request conflicts with an ingestion process already in progress. |
| **429 Too Many Requests** | Rate Limit | Request denied due to rate limiting. |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on the server side. |

---

### Assumptions:
- Digitize documents pod/container mounted with a Read/Write persistent volume and data persists over restarts to store cached results
- In case of multiple replicas, same volume should be shared to maintain the ingestion job status
- During ingestion
    - User should pass files with unique names
    - In case user pass same file again, vdb will be upserted
