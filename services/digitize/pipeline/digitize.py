"""
Digitization pipeline entry-point.

Drives the single-document digitization job lifecycle:
poll conversion_tasks → mark status.

The conversion itself is now owned entirely by the dispatcher
(workers/conversion_dispatcher.py).  This function just waits for the
dispatcher to mark the task as completed or failed, then surfaces the
result through the standard job/doc status updates.

    Poll the conversion_tasks row inserted by ``POST /v1/jobs`` until the
    dispatcher marks it terminal (completed or failed).

    The dispatcher handles conversion, semaphore management, and writes
    the result_path when it succeeds.  This function's only job is to
    wait and propagate the final status.

    Args:
        directory_path:    Staging directory (kept for call-site compatibility).
        job_id:            Job identifier.
        doc_id_dict:       Mapping from filename to document ID.
        output_format:     Output format (unused — task row already carries it).
        file_checksum_dict: Pre-computed SHA-256 checksums keyed by filename.
                            Passed through for any post-completion metadata
