"""
Weighted semaphore for Docling conversion capacity management.

Each conversion task acquires a number of *weight units* from the semaphore
before starting and releases them when done.  The total capacity mirrors
``doc_worker_size`` (default 4) so the semaphore and the underlying
``ProcessPoolExecutor`` agree on the available parallelism budget.

Weight rule:
  - Normal file (page_count <= heavy_doc_page_threshold):  weight = 1
  - Large file  (page_count >  heavy_doc_page_threshold):  weight = 2
